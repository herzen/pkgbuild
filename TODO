Some things I'm planning fix/add:
 - support all rpm 4 spec file elements (need to figure out what's missing)
 - fix/implement version checking (currently dependencies check pkg names only)
 - add support for SVr4 "space files", see space(4) on Solaris
 - on Linux, generate plain rpm spec files and call rpmbuild to do the build
 - .rcfile support
 - rpm macro support
 - automatic regression tests
 - support for building straight from CVS (?)
 - implement autoreqprov
 - implement BuildConflicts: /path/to/file
 - implement RequireArch / RequireOS
