	  - use standard perl functions instead of system() calls or
	    regex operations for lots of stuff, thanks to Damien for

	  i.e. do not append the date after it.  Note: this is an
	  incompatible change!  Existing uses of SUNW_Rev need to
	  append .%(date +%Y.%m.%d.%H.%M.%S)

	  Slight change in the way %config and %class files work:
	   - %config files that belong to class none are volatile

	     prototype
